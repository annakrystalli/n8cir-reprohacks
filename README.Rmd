<br>

We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**. 

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It's imperative to note that  **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research community as a whole.


***

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### **[Nominate a paper](`r params$submission_url`)**

We invite nominations for papers that have both associated **code** and **data** publicly available. We also encourage analyses based on open source tools as we cannot guarantee participants will have access to specialised licenced software.

[**Current list of proposed papers and projects**](`r params$paper_shinyapp_url`)

<br>


```{r, echo = F, results='asis'}
if(!is.null(params$registration_url)){
  cat(paste0("### [**REGISTER as a participant**](", params$registration_url, ")"))
}
```

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about **reproducibility**, working with **other people's code and data** and more!

***


## **On the day**

This is the master repo of the hack. We'll collect information on the teams and projects through [issues](`r paste0(params$reprohack_repo_url, "/issues/")`) in this repo. We'll track of discussions and collaborative notes on the event [**hackpad**](`r params$hackpad_url`)

As all ReproHack events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [ReproHack Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.



### **Authors**

We encourage authors that are keen, to be available for participants to reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello! You can do so by joining the **`review-chat`** channel in our [**slack**](https://reprohack-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/) group. We've also set up an **`authors`** channel in our [**slack**](https://reprohack-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/) group as a place where you can also reach the organisers prior to the hack. You can also start discussions or add comments through our collaborative [**hackpad**](`r params$hackpad_url`).

### **Participants**

#### **Introduction & Welcome** [slides](`r params$intro_slides_url`)

#### **1. Paper review and team formation**

We'll start with a brief review of the [**papers proposed**](`r params$paper_shinyapp_url`) and then form into teams. Feel free to work on your own if you prefer but we highly recommend you discuss your experiences with fellow participants as you work.


#### **2. Select and register a paper**

- Add your details in the **participants** section of the [**hackpad**](`r params$hackpad_url`) so we have a complete list of participants.
- In your teams **decide which paper** you wish to work on.
- **Register your team and paper** by logging the title of the selected paper and the name(s) of the reviewer(s) in the [**hackpad**](`r params$hackpad_url`). You can use the following template:
  ```
  ### **Paper:** <Title of the paper reproduced>
  **Reviewers:** Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.
  ```


#### **3. Work on your paper!**

Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try and reproduce the work. As you work through your paper, keep in mind the main points on which feedback to the authors will provided, **Access**, **Reproducibility**, **Documentation** and **Reusability**. It might help to have a look at the [feedback form](`r params$feedback_url`) before you begin and keep notes during. Feel free to use the event hackpad to record general findings you wish to share with the group.

We'll **come together during the day** to discuss progress and troubleshoot any sticking points. 

Should you finish reproducing your paper quickly, feel free to explore the work more deeply. For example, you could try and run additional analyses, create new plots or even combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

You might want to consider attempting to **replicate** the results, for example, if the code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining whether you are getting the same results. Such a contribution would be appropriate for publication in the **ReScience C** journal! Have a look at the journals [website](http://rescience.github.io/write/) for further details. 

Should you produce any additional materials relating to your reproduction during the session, we ask that you **share it publicly** and **add any links to such materials to the hackpad**.

#### **4. Leave feedback for the authors**

Please complete the [**Reproducibility feedback form**](`r params$feedback_url`). Please also remember to be kind and constructive. Reproducibilty is hard and all authors submitting their papers have been incredibly brave. Here's an [example](https://github.com/annakrystalli/write-ups/blob/master/assets/OpenCon_ReproHack%20feedback_form.pdf) of feedback to authors.


#### **5. Feedback to the group on your experiences**

You can use the hackpad to take notes and summarise your experiences.

#### **Closing Remarks**

***

#### Collaborative note taking:

Feel free to contribute any additional thoughts on our collaborative [**hackpad**](`r params$hackpad_url`). These can help form the basis for a blogpost on the event.
