# Ice breaker:  Introductions

&lt;!-- Use this section as an ice-breaker. Introduce yourself, then allow others to 
go around the room and introduce themselves too --&gt;

---

&lt;!-- Add details about yourself the organiser here: --&gt;

## Who am I?

&gt; ### Dr Anna Krystalli (@annakrystalli)
&gt; 
&gt; - Research Software Engineer _University of Sheffield_
&gt;
&gt; - 2019 Fellow _Software Sustainability Institute_
&gt;
&gt; - Software Peer Review Editor _rOpenSci_ 
&gt;
&gt; - Co-organiser _Sheffield R Users Group_

---

## Why am I here?

&gt; I believe there's lots to learn about Reproducibility from working with other people's materials and engaging with real published research code and data.

---

## Who is my favorite animated character?

&gt; Stitch!

# Tips for Reproducing &amp; Reviewing

---

## ReproHack Objectives

1. **Practical Experience in Reproducibility**

3. **Feedback to Authors**

5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

## Code of Conduct

Event governed by **ReproHack Code of Conduct** [bit.ly/reprohack-coc](https://bit.ly/reprohack-coc)

.pull-right[
### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!
- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

### Thank you Authors! 🙌 

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their efforts. 🙏 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!

# 🔍 Reproducing &amp; Reviewing


&lt;img src="assets/Hackathon.jpg" width="70%" /&gt;

## Selecting Papers

.pull-left[
- **Information submitted by authors:**

  - Languages / tools used
  
  - Why you should attempt the paper.
  
- **No. attempts <i class="fas  fa-recycle "></i>** No. times reproduction has been attempted

- **Mean Repro Score <i class="fas  fa-check-circle "></i>** Mean reproducibility score (out of 10)

    - lower == harder!
    
- Register paper using template in hackpad:
    ```
    ### **Paper:** &lt;Title of the paper reproduced&gt;
    **Reviewers:** Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.
    ```

# 🔍 For FAIR materials

&lt;img src="assets/FAIRPrinciples.jpg" width="80%" /&gt;

.pull-left[

# Access

- How **easy** was it to **gain** access to the materials?

- Did you manage to download all the files you needed?

]

--

.pull-right[

# Installation

- How **easy / automated** was **installation**?

- Did you have any problems?

- How did you solve them?
]

--- 
---

.pull-left[


# Data

- Were **data clearly separated from code and other items**?

- Were **large data files deposited in a trustworthy data repository** and referred to using a **persistent identifier**?

- Were **data documented** ...somehow...

]

--

.pull-right[

# Documentation

Was there **adequate documentation** describing:
- how to **install** necessary software including non-standard dependencies?

- how to **use** materials to reproduce the paper?

- how to **cite** the materials, ideally in a form that can be copy and pasted?

]

# Analysis

- **Were you able to fully reproduce** the paper? ✅

- **How automated** was the process of reproducing the paper?

- **How easy was it to link** analysis **code** to:
   - the **plots** it generates
   - **sections in the manuscript** in which it is described and results reported
]
--

.pull-right[

&lt;br&gt;

### If the analysis was not fully reproducible 🚫
 - Were there **missing dependencies?**
 
 - Was the **computational environment not adequately described** / captured?
 
 - Was there **bugs** in the code?
 
 - Did **code run but results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ** to those published? By **how much?**

## Finished early?

### Explore the work more deeply:

- Try and run additional analyses.

- Create new plots. 

- Combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

---


### Participation guidelines

#### During talks information sessions and regroups
- Please stay on mute until you are invited to speak.
- Add questions for speakers on the hackpad

#### During break out work 
- Try and engage as much as possible.
- Feel free to mute, turn off camera and disconnect if you need to.
- Feel free to move around and go say hello or help out in other rooms.
- We encourage discussions in the break-out rooms but be mindful of others trying to work. The **main room** and **cafe** are always available for hanging out.
