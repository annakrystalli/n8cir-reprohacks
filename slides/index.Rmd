# Tips for Reproducing & Reviewing

---

## ReproHack Objectives

1. **Practical Experience in Reproducibility**

3. **Feedback to Authors**

5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

## Code of Conduct

Event governed by **ReproHack Code of Conduct** [bit.ly/reprohack-coc](https://bit.ly/reprohack-coc)

### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!
- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

### Thank you Authors! `r emo::ji("raised_hands")` 

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their efforts. `r emo::ji("pray")` 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!

## Selecting Papers

.pull-left[
- **Information submitted by authors:**

  - Languages / tools used
  
  - Why you should attempt the paper.
  
- **No. attempts `r icon::fa('recycle')`** No. times reproduction has been attempted

- **Mean Repro Score `r icon::fa('check-circle')`** Mean reproducibility score (out of 10)

    - lower == harder!
    
- Register paper using template in hackpad:
    ```
    ### **Paper:** <Title of the paper reproduced>
    **Reviewers:** Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.
    ```

# Access

- How **easy** was it to **gain** access to the materials?

- Did you manage to download all the files you needed?

# Installation

- How **easy / automated** was **installation**?

- Did you have any problems?

- How did you solve them?

# Data

- Were **data clearly separated from code and other items**?

- Were **large data files deposited in a trustworthy data repository** and referred to using a **persistent identifier**?

- Were **data documented** ...somehow...

.pull-right[

# Documentation

Was there **adequate documentation** describing:
- how to **install** necessary software including non-standard dependencies?

- how to **use** materials to reproduce the paper?

- how to **cite** the materials, ideally in a form that can be copy and pasted?

# Analysis

- **Were you able to fully reproduce** the paper? `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")`

- **How automated** was the process of reproducing the paper?

- **How easy was it to link** analysis **code** to:
   - the **plots** it generates
   - **sections in the manuscript** in which it is described and results reported

### If the analysis was not fully reproducible `r emo::ji("no_entry_sign")`
 - Were there **missing dependencies?**
 
 - Was the **computational environment not adequately described** / captured?
 
 - Was there **bugs** in the code?
 
 - Did **code run but results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ** to those published? By **how much?**

# Additional activities

---

## Finished early?

### Explore the work more deeply:

- Try and run additional analyses.

- Create new plots. 

- Combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

---


### Participation guidelines

#### During talks information sessions and regroups
- Please stay on mute until you are invited to speak.
- Add questions for speakers on the hackpad

#### During break out work 
- Try and engage as much as possible.
- Feel free to mute, turn off camera and disconnect if you need to.
- Feel free to move around and go say hello or help out in other rooms.
- We encourage discussions in the break-out rooms but be mindful of others trying to work. The **main room** and **cafe** are always available for hanging out.

### At any time
- Feel free to add to the collaborative notes on the hackpad
- Contact facilitators through the main chat
