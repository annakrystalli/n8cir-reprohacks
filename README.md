# Welcome to the **Awesome conference / organiser \#ReproHack**\!

<br>

We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their
papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**.

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of
the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience
for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It’s imperative to note that **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to
criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial
scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and
valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research
community as a whole.

-----

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### **[Nominate a paper](https://link-to-submissionform)**

We invite nominations for papers that have both associated **code** and
**data** publicly available. We also encourage analyses based on open
source tools as we cannot guarantee participants will have access to
specialised licenced software.

[**Current list of proposed papers and
projects**](https://youraccount.shinyapps.io/reprohack-awesome-conf)

<br>

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about
**reproducibility**, working with **other people’s code and data** and
more\!

-----

## **On the day**

This is the master repo of the hack. We’ll collect information on the
teams and projects through
[issues](https://github.com/your_account/reprohack-location-ISOdate/issues/)
in this repo. We’ll track of discussions and collaborative notes on the
event [**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/link-to-copy-of-hackpad/edit)

As all Carpentries events, we strive to make this event open and
inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [Carpentries Code
of
Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code.

### **Authors**

We encourage authors that are keen, to be available for participants to
reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello\! We’ve set up a
[**gitter channel**](https://gitter.im/reprohack/community) as a public
lobby where you can also reach the organisers prior to the hack. You can
also start discussions or add comments through our collaborative
[**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/link-to-copy-of-hackpad/edit).

### **Participants**

#### **Introduction & Welcome** [slides]()

#### **1. Project review and team formation**

We’ll start with a brief review of the [**papers
proposed**](https://youraccount.shinyapps.io/reprohack-awesome-conf) and
then form into teams.

#### **2. Select and register your project**

  - In your teams **decide which paper/hack topic** you wish to work on.
  - To register your team and paper / topic [**open a new
    issue**](https://github.com/your_account/reprohack-location-ISOdate/issues/new/choose)
    in this repository using the issue templates provided.
  - **Complete details** and create.
  - Please also add each individual participants details in the relevant
    section of the
    [**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/link-to-copy-of-hackpad/edit) so we
    have a complete list of participants.

#### **3. Work on your project\!**

Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try
and reproduce the work. As you work through your paper, keep in mind the
main points on which feedback to the authors will provided,
**Reproducibility**, **Documentation** and **Reusability**. It might
help to have a look at the [feedback form](https://link-to-feedbackform)
before you begin and keep notes during. Feel free to use the event
hackpad for that.

We’ll **come together during the day** to discuss progress and
troubleshoot any sticking points.

Should you finish reproducing your paper quickly, you might want to
consider attempting to **replicate** the results, for example, if the
code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining
whether you are getting the same results. Such a contribution would be
appropriate for publication in the **ReScience C** journal\! Have a look
at the journals [website](http://rescience.github.io/write/) for further
details.

Should you produce any additional materials relating to your
reproduction during the session, we ask that you **share it publicly**
and **update your team’s issue with any relevant URLs**.

#### **4. Leave feedback for the authors**

Please complete the [**Reproducibility feedback
form**](https://link-to-feedbackform). Please also remember to be kind
and constructive. Reproducibilty is hard and all authors submitting
their papers have been incredibly brave. Here’s an
[example](https://github.com/annakrystalli/write-ups/blob/master/assets/OpenCon_ReproHack%20feedback_form.pdf)
of feedback to authors.

#### **5. Feedback to the group on your experiences**

You can use the hackpad to take notes and summarise your experiences.

#### **Closing Remarks**

-----

#### Collaborative note taking:

Feel free to contribute any additional thoughts on our collaborative
[**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/link-to-copy-of-hackpad/edit). These can
help form the basis for a blogpost on the
event.
