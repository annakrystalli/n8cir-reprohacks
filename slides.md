# Introductions

<!-- Use this section as an ice-breaker. Introduce yourself, then allow others to 
go around the room and introduce themselves too -->

<!-- Add details about yourself the organiser here: -->

## Who am I?

### Dr Anna Krystalli (@annakrystalli)

- Research Software Engineer _University of Sheffield_
- 2019 Fellow _Software Sustainability Institute_
- Software Peer Review Editor _rOpenSci_ 
- Co-organiser _Sheffield R Users Group_

## Why am I here?

I believe there's lots to learn about Reproducibility from working with real published projects.

# Plan of Action

---

### Reproduce paper

1. **Project review and team formation**


2. **Select and register your project**

3. **Work on your project!**

4. **Re-group part-way through.**

6. **Feedback at the end (group & authors)**



---


## Code of Conduct

Event governed by [**ReproHack Code of Conduct**](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)

<br>

### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!
- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!



---

## Thank you Authors! :raised_hands: 

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their effort and bravery. :pray: 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!

# Reproduce and Review

# :mag:

---

## Review as an auditor :bookmark_tabs:

---


## Access

- How easy was it to gain access to the materials?

## Installation

- How easy / automated was installation?
- Did you have any problems?


## Data
- Were data clearly separated from code and other items?
- Were large data files deposited in a trustworthy data repository and referred to using a persistent identifier?
- Were data documented ...somehow...

---


## Documentation

Was there adequate documentation describing:
- how to install necessary software including non-standard dependencies?
- how to use materials to reproduce the paper?
- how to cite the materials, ideally in a form that can be copy and pasted?


## Analysis

- Were you able to fully reproduce the paper? :white_check_mark:
- How automated was the process of reproducing the paper?
- How easy was it to link analysis code to:
   - the plots it generates
   - sections in the manuscript in which it is described
 
### If the analysis was not fully reproducible :no_entry_sign:
 - Did results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ to those published? By how much?
 - Were missing dependencies?
 - Was the computational environment not adequately described / captured?

---

## Review as a user :video_game:

<br>

#### What did you find easy / intuitive?



#### What did you find confusing / difficult



#### What did you enjoy?

---

# Feed back

# :speech_balloon: 

---


## Feedback as a community member

<br>

### Acknowledge author effort

### Give feedback in good faith

### Focus on community benefits
- and system level solutions

---

### Feed back opportunities

- **Regroup part way through** to discuss progress and troubleshoot any sticking points
- **Feedback to authors** using form by end of session
- **Feedback to group** at the end, contribute to discussions

---

# Additional activities

---

## Finished early?


### Explore the work more deeply:
- Try and run additional analyses.
- Create new plots. 
- Combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!


### Replicate your paper

- Consider attempting **replication**!
- Replications could be considered for publication in **ReScience C** Journal

---

## [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/)

> **ReScience C** is an open-access peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the **explicit replication** of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research is reproducible.


### What is **Replication:** 
- Repeating a published protocol
- Respecting its spirit and intentions
-  **Varying the technical details**, e.g. using different software, initial conditions, etc.

#### Change something that everyone believes shouldnâ€™t matter, and see if the scientific conclusions are affected 


---

# Let's go! :checkered_flag: 

---

## 1. Paper review

+ Have a look at the papers available for reproduction


## 2. Team formation / project registration

+ Fine to work individually
+ Add your details to the [**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/@annakrystalli/n8-reprohack/edit).
+ Register your team and paper on the [**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/@annakrystalli/n8-reprohack/edit)



## 3. Mid-point regroup

- Which paper have you selected? Briefly describe what it's about.
- Briefly describe the approach to reproducibility the paper has taken.
- Anything in particular you like about the paper's approach so far?
- Anything you're having difficulty with?

---

## 4. Feedback to authors

- **Please complete the feedback form for authors**
- Feel free to record general findings the hackpad

---

## 5. Final regroup

- So, how did you get on? 
- Final comments.
- If there's time, tackle some discussion topics (see hackpad).
- On post-its: One thing you liked, one thing that can be improved.
